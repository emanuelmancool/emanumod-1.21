# EMANUMOD
Hello, and to anyone reading, if you exist, this is my FIRST mod, if you somehow actually want to check it out, you're going to have to build it yourself, to find out how, scroll a little bit.

For now im having some fun with the mod, the main "resource" is green paper, which will be used for most if not all things I add in the future. There is a new creative inventory tab with all things from the mod!

lastly, thank you to **KAUPENJOE** and his 1.21 fabric modding series!!

# BUILDING THE MOD

okay ill be honest, I didn't do this myself yet, but, I think all that is needed is:

1. Clone the repo
2. Open in IntelliJ IDEA (or another Java IDE)
3. Open terminal in project root and run: `./gradlew build`
4. Find your mod jar in `build/libs/`

I haven't done it myself, so if someone is actually reading this and tries to build it, and it doesn't work, I think you can submit an issue.
