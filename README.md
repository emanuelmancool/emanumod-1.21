# EMANUMOD
Hello, and to anyone reading, if you exist, this is my FIRST mod, if you somehow actually want to check it out, youre gonna have to build it yourself or whatever

For now im having some fun with the mod, the main "resource" is green paper, which will be used for most if not all things i add in the future

lastly, thank you to **KAUPENJOE** and his 1.21 fabric modding series!!
